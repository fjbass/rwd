        The aim of the course is to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of algorithmic thinking, allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to real-world computational problems by building on the principles of mathematics.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The course will enable the student to apply a wide range of existing algorithms and data structures for fundamental problems, as well as general methods for developing new algorithms and mathematical tools for analyzing the correctness and efficiency of algorithms. This is of paramount importance for the ability to develop efficient software, and is central to the understanding of upper and lower bounds for computational problems.
      </p>
